# Clickatell account signup

If you already have a Clickatell Central account, proceed to Step 2 for instructions on how to edit an API connection on your account.


If you do not already have a Clickatell Central account, you need to register for one. You can do so at https://www.clickatell.com/register/?productid=1 by signing up for the Developers' Central product. On sign up for you will be given a username, password and a client ID. Please note that the client ID is not the same thing as the API ID, which we will setup later. If you registered for the trial, you will have received 10 free credits with which to test the service. Messages sent with these credits contain a canned (pre-populated) message. You can test the API using these credits or purchase credits to start sending your own customised messages.
